## About

This is a web game designed to be played on a variety of devices. The graphics assets are SVG, but all rendering is done via full-page `<canvas>`. There are no frameworks or libraries, only vanilla JS.

The game play supports interaction via keyboard, mouse, touch, and pointer devices.

So far, it's been tested at a fairly smooth ~57-60fps performance on:

* OSX: Chrome, FF, Safari
* Android 5: Chrome, FF
* iOS 8, 9 (iPad3, iPhone5, iPhone6): Safari

Obviously, this is a work in progress. There's much to do. Help is definitely appreciated!
